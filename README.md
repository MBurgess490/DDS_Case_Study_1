# Doing_Data_Science

This project is a joint effort between myself, Michael Burgess, and Rob Pollock. We were tasked with performing an exploratory data analysis of the provided beer and brewery datasets and answering 9 specific questions. The datasets and project criteria can be found in the Data Files folder. 

The code for this analysis was written in an R markdown format and is also provided in an HTML knit output. These files along with the code book explaining our variables can be found in the R Markdown folder.

In this case study our target audience was the CEO and CFO of Budweiser and the slides for our presentation can be found in the presentation Slides folder.
