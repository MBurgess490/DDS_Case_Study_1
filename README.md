# Doing_Data_Science

This project is a joint effort between Michael Burgess and Rob Pollock. We were tasked with answering 9 questions for the CEO and the CFO of Budweiser using the provided beer 
and brewery datasets. These files can be found in the repo. The code for answering these questions is contained in the markdown file and the output is contained in the knitted html file. The code book contains information on the variables that were used throughout the markdown and html files.
